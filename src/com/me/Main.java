/*
- create a simple interface (tip: name it Saveable or ISaveable)
- that interface allows an object to be saved to some sort of storage medium. (tip: use arraylist)
- the exact type of medium is not known to the interface (nor to the classes that implement it).
- the interface will just specify 2 methods, one to return an arraylist of values to be saved
and the other to populate the object's fields from an arraylist (parameter).
- create a few sample classes that implement your Saveable interface (we've used tthe idea of a game,
with players and monsters, but you can create any type of classes that you want).
- override the toString()method for each of your classes so that they can be easily printed to enable
the program to be tested easier.
- in main, write a method that takes an object that implements the interface as a parameter and
"saves" the values, ex. calls the method defined in the interface.
- we haven't covered I/O yet, so your method should just print the values to the screen.
- also in the main class, write a method that retores the values to a saveable object
ex. calls the mthod from the interface for populating fields (see above)
- again we are not going to use java file I/O; instead use the readValues() method below to
simulate getting values from a file - this allows you to type as many values as your class
requires, and returns an arraylist
